          <br /><b>Welcome to my Vue.js UI/UX portfolio demo!</b><br />
          My name is Christopher Peterson. As a Full-Stack Senior Software
          Engineer, I began learning front-end UI/UX not only to well-round my
          skills, but also to achieve my overall goal of delivering the best
          user experience possible.<br />
          The code for this project, as well as my others, can be found at the
